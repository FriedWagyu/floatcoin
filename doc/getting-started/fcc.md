# üè¶ FCC

The $FCC token will serve as the central governance component and risk management hub for the protocol. To participate in voting, receive a share of the treasury income, and earn $FCC rewards, users must secure FCC/FLOAT LP tokens through staking. In turn, the FCC/FLOAT pool will act as a buffer for selling FCC in the event of under-collateralization in the treasury.

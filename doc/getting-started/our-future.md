# ðŸ—º Our Future

## Phase I. State of Chill

The protocol is considered robust with a collateral of only 5LP and a CR of 200%. We do not anticipate any risks for the $FCC selling event at this point.

## Phase II. Amplification

Our approach is to gradually adjust the CR until it reaches a proximity of 100%, which will enable us to mint more $FLOAT and maximize the utilization of user funds.

## Phase III. Undestroyable

During Phase III, additional tokens such as $BTC, $ETH Pools, as well as FCC/FLOAT Pool, will be accepted as collateral. By using cryptocurrencies as collateral, the project's treasury can increase its real value, resulting in greater income for the treasury.

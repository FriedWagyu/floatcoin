# âš– Stability Mechanism

Our stability mechanism is straightforward: $1 of $FLOAT can be exchanged for $1 of $5LP. Keeping our starting 200% collateral ratio in mind, it is highly improbable for $FLOAT to fall below the required collateral amount. Nonetheless, if the collateral falls underwater, a TWAMM mechanism comes into play, wherein F$CC will be sold for $FLOAT to maintain a minimum of 100% collateral ratio.

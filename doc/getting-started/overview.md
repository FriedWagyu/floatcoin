# ðŸ‘€ Overview

In our [whitepaper](../), we talked about the significance of an inflation-resistant token (flatcoin). We believe that a flatcoin can provide true value stability to users, as well as be applied to wages, unconditional basic income, and more. For example:

* When users receive wage in Floatcoin, they no longer need to choose a investment method to retain the value
* Whats more?&#x20;

Our product is secured by two parties:

* Floatcoin ($FLOAT) will be the first stablecoin pegged to US CPI. $FLOAT is designed to maintain its purchasing power through on-chain stability mechanisms that keep its value constant relative to the price of all items in the CPI basket.
* Floatcoin Committee ($FCC) will be the governance token of the ecosystem. $FCC holders will receive any additional yield from the treasury, and if the $FLOAT treasury is unable to maintain the increased backing per $FLOAT due to inflation, new $FCC tokens may be created and sold to bolster the treasury.

# ðŸ”± 5 Pools (5LP)

Our aim is for $FLOAT to serve as a substitute for the US dollar-pegged stablecoin in certain functions, which is why we require as much exposure as possible from stablecoins. Initially, only 5 Pools (5LP) namely USDC/USDT/DAI/FRAX/crvUSD will be accessible for minting and redeeming $FLOAT. This selection aims to diversify the portfolio and provide necessary stablecoin liquidity to the ecosystem.
